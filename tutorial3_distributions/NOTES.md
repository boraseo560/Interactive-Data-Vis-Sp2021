1. This week I was not able to do any exciting adventure. I only changed the size and colors of circle, and direction and duration in transition.
2. I wanted to change the shape and find good reference, but failed to realize it. I was not sure about how to apply shapes, dropdown, and transition at the same time. (I should try changing shape first without dropdown or transition and then apply them.)
