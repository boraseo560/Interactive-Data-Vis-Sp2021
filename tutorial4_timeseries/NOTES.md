I am confused about how to organize variable names/functions when I am creating multiple chart in single HTML page.

1. Do I need to separate .js file for each chart?
2. For global instances/variables, do they affect all .js file? / Can all .js file share global instances/variables without importing like Python?
3. Do I need to change every variable/function names even though I am almost reusing them? Is there any way that I can save the resources?
