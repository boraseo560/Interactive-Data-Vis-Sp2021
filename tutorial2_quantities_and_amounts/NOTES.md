Multiple Challenges (response to Q1 and Q3 above):

- How to get the x and y-axis (in both charts) to fit inside the svg? I tried it, but the labels were cut out of the svg. I realized that I need to understand the concept of margin.
- How to move the x-axis (in the vertical chart) to the bottom of the bars?
- How to show y-axis labels (in the horizontal chart) on the right side of each bar?
- What is the difference between d => d.~ and function (d) return ~~~? Which one is more efficient?
- How to use interpolate?
- How to set the relationship between divs in HTML and svgs in JS in single CSS file?
